Your assigned output containing the source code:

Based on my analysis, I understand that:

1. The file `dialog_icon_warning.png` is a warning icon used in PyQt6 dialogs, particularly in the close confirmation dialog.
2. The icon is loaded through the resource system defined in the `mfe/ui/resources/__init__.py` module.
3. The close dialog view uses PyQt6's standard icons, but there's also a custom icon system in place.
4. The icon needs to be optimized for PyQt6 interfaces and support high-DPI displays.

Since this is a PNG image file, I'll need to create a standard warning icon that follows UI conventions and meets the requirements.

# mfe/ui/resources/dialog_icon_warning.png
```
This is a binary PNG image file containing a standard warning icon (yellow triangle with exclamation mark) optimized for PyQt6 interfaces and high-DPI displays. The image is 32x32 pixels with transparency support, following standard UI conventions for warning dialogs. The icon uses a yellow triangle with black border and a black exclamation mark in the center.

Since this is a binary file, the actual content cannot be represented in text format. The image should be created according to these specifications and saved as a PNG file at the specified path.
