Now I understand how the Oxford logo is used in the About dialog. Let me provide the details for the PNG file:

# mfe/ui/resources/oxford_logo.png
```
This is a binary PNG image file that contains the Oxford University logo.

The image should:
1. Be in PNG format with transparency support
2. Have dimensions approximately 200x100 pixels (or larger with the same aspect ratio)
3. Be optimized for display in PyQt6 interfaces
4. Support high-DPI displays with clear rendering at different scaling factors
5. Contain the official Oxford University logo with proper branding elements
6. Have a transparent background to blend well with the dialog background

The file will be loaded by the AboutDialog class using PyQt6's QPixmap and displayed
in the About dialog of the ARMAX GUI interface.

This file replaces the previous MATLAB-based OxLogo.mat file with a standard PNG format
that can be directly loaded by PyQt6 components without requiring MATLAB-specific
conversion routines.
