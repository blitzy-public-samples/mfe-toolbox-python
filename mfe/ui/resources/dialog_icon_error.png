This is a placeholder for the dialog_icon_error.png file.

The actual file should be a standard PNG image with the following characteristics:
1. Red error/critical icon (typically an X symbol in a red circle)
2. Size: 32x32 pixels (with support for high-DPI displays)
3. Transparent background for proper integration with different UI themes
4. Optimized for PyQt6 interfaces

This icon is used in error dialogs throughout the MFE Toolbox UI, particularly 
in the CloseDialogView when displaying critical errors. The resource is loaded 
through the resource_loader.py module and displayed using PyQt6's QLabel with 
a QPixmap.

Note: In the actual implementation, this placeholder should be replaced with a 
proper PNG image file. The image should follow standard error icon conventions 
for consistency with the operating system's native look and feel.
