Based on the information I've gathered, I need to create a logo for the MFE Toolbox Python project. Since this is a binary image file (PNG), I can't directly generate the actual image in this text-based environment. However, I can provide a detailed description of what the logo should look like, which can be used to create the actual image file.

# docs/_static/logo.png
```
This is a binary image file (PNG format) that should be created with the following specifications:

1. Design Elements:
   - Modern, clean design that represents a Python-based financial econometrics toolbox
   - Color scheme: Python blue (#306998) and yellow (#FFD43B) as primary colors
   - Include a stylized "MFE" text as the main element
   - Incorporate Python-related visual elements (such as a subtle Python logo or snake)
   - Optional mathematical/financial elements like a graph line, matrix, or statistical symbol

2. Technical Specifications:
   - Format: PNG with transparency
   - Size: 200x60 pixels (standard for sidebar logos in Sphinx documentation)
   - Resolution: 72 DPI (standard for web)
   - Color mode: RGB with alpha channel for transparency

3. Style Guidelines:
   - Clean, professional appearance suitable for academic/financial software
   - Legible at small sizes (as it will be used in documentation sidebar)
   - Modern typography with sans-serif font for "MFE Toolbox"
   - Subtle indication of Python implementation (could be through color scheme or small Python logo)
   - Balanced visual weight that works well on both light and dark backgrounds

4. Contextual Usage:
   - Primary use is in the documentation sidebar header
   - Also used as the basis for favicon.ico
   - Should be recognizable at small sizes
   - Should maintain visual connection to the original MFE Toolbox while indicating Python reimplementation
