Based on the information I've gathered, I understand that I need to create a logo image file for the MFE Toolbox Python project. Since this is an image file and not a code file, I'll provide a description of what the logo should be rather than generating actual code.

# docs/_static/logo.png
```
This file should be a PNG image that serves as the logo for the MFE Toolbox Python project.

The logo should:
1. Reflect the modern Python implementation of the MFE Toolbox
2. Use the color scheme defined in the CSS (primary blue #4287f5, secondary purple #5b39f3, accent yellow #ffd966)
3. Be appropriately sized for web documentation (recommended dimensions around 200x200px)
4. Include visual elements that represent both financial econometrics and Python
5. Maintain a visual connection to the original MFE Toolbox while indicating the Python reimplementation
6. Be in PNG format with transparency support for flexible placement in the documentation
7. Be optimized for web display with appropriate resolution and file size

The logo will be used in the documentation header (as specified in conf.py with html_logo = '_static/logo.png') 
and as a favicon for the documentation website.
