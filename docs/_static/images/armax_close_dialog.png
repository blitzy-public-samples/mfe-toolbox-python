I'll analyze this task and determine what needs to be done. I need to create an image file for the ARMAX close dialog based on the technical specification. Since this is an image file, I can't directly generate the binary content, but I can provide a detailed description of what the image should contain based on the requirements.

Let me first understand what's needed for this file by examining the technical specification and the key changes listed.

Based on the information provided, I need to describe what the `armax_close_dialog.png` image should look like, following the PyQt6 implementation mentioned in the technical specification.

# docs/_static/images/armax_close_dialog.png
```
This file should be a PNG image showing a PyQt6 QMessageBox dialog with the following characteristics:

1. Standard PyQt6 QMessageBox warning dialog with a warning icon on the left side
2. Dialog title "Confirm Close" at the top of the window
3. Message text: "Are you sure you want to close the ARMAX GUI? All unsaved changes will be lost."
4. Two buttons at the bottom: "Cancel" (left) and "Close" (right)
5. Modern dialog styling consistent with PyQt6's default appearance
6. The dialog should appear as a modal window centered over the main application
7. Standard window decoration including a close [x] button in the title bar
8. Warning icon should use the standard PyQt6 warning icon (yellow triangle with exclamation mark)
9. The dialog should have a clean, modern appearance following Qt6 design principles
10. Text should be clearly readable with proper spacing and alignment

This image will be used in the documentation to illustrate the confirmation dialog that appears when users attempt to close the ARMAX application, providing a visual reference for this safeguard in the user workflow.
