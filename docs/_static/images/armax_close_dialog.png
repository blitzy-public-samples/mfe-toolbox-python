Your assigned output containing the source code:

I'll analyze this task carefully. I need to create a PNG image file for the ARMAX close dialog based on the technical specification. Since this is an image file, I'll need to understand what it should contain based on the specification and then provide guidance on what this image should look like.

Let me examine the technical specification to understand the requirements for this dialog.

From the specification, I can see that:
1. The close confirmation dialog should be implemented with PyQt6's modal dialog (QMessageBox)
2. It should feature standard confirmation buttons and an icon
3. It should display a warning message about unsaved changes
4. It should follow modern dialog design principles

Since I can't directly create a PNG image file, I'll provide a detailed description of what this image should contain.

# docs/_static/images/armax_close_dialog.png
```
This file should be a PNG image showing a PyQt6 QMessageBox dialog with the following characteristics:

1. Standard warning icon (yellow triangle with exclamation mark)
2. Dialog title "Confirm Close" at the top of the window
3. Message text: "Are you sure you want to close the ARMAX GUI? All unsaved changes will be lost."
4. Two buttons at the bottom: "Cancel" (left) and "Close" (right)
5. Modern, clean dialog styling consistent with PyQt6's default appearance
6. Proper window decoration including close [x] button in the title bar
7. Centered text with appropriate spacing and margins
8. Size approximately 400-500 pixels wide by 200-250 pixels tall

The image should be captured at an appropriate resolution (e.g., 96 DPI) with a transparent or white background to integrate well with various documentation themes.
