I'll analyze this task carefully. I need to create a PNG image file for the ARMAX main UI interface. Since this is a binary image file and not code that can be directly written in text, I should explain what would be needed to create this file.

The file `docs/_static/images/armax_main_ui.png` is a screenshot image showing the PyQt6-based ARMAX modeling interface. This would need to be created by:

1. Implementing the actual PyQt6 UI application described in the technical specification
2. Running the application
3. Taking a screenshot of the interface
4. Saving it as a PNG file in the specified location

Since I can't generate the actual binary image file in this text-based environment, I'll note that this file would need to be created separately through the process described above.

The image should show the ARMAX modeling interface with:
- Model specification controls (AR/MA orders, constant toggle, exogenous variables)
- Data visualization panels with matplotlib plots
- Diagnostic areas
- Action buttons for model estimation and parameter reset
- Tab controls for different views of results
- Modern PyQt6 styling that differs from the original MATLAB interface
- Progress indicators for asynchronous operations

This image would serve as documentation for users to understand the new Python-based interface that replaces the original MATLAB GUI.
