Your assigned output containing the source code:

I'll analyze this task and determine the best approach for creating the required image file.

This task involves creating a PNG image file for the ARMAX main UI interface. Since this is an image file rather than code, I need to understand what's expected here.

The file path is `docs/_static/images/armax_main_ui.png`, which indicates this is a static image resource for documentation. The summary indicates it should be a screenshot of the PyQt6-based ARMAX interface that replaces the original MATLAB GUI.

Since I can't directly generate image files, I should provide guidance on what this image should contain based on the technical specification.

# docs/_static/images/armax_main_ui.png
```
This file should be a PNG image showing the main ARMAX interface with the following elements:

1. Model Specification area with:
   - AR Order input controls (spinner or text field with +/- buttons)
   - MA Order input controls (spinner or text field with +/- buttons)
   - "Include Constant" checkbox
   - Exogenous Variables input field
   - "Estimate Model" button
   - "Reset Parameters" button

2. Visualization area with:
   - Original time series data plot (matplotlib embedded in PyQt6)
   - Residual plot panel
   - Model statistics panel showing metrics like AIC, BIC, Log-likelihood

3. Tab controls for switching between:
   - Model Results
   - Diagnostics
   - Plots

4. About/Help buttons

5. Progress indicators for asynchronous processing (not present in MATLAB version)

The image should follow modern Python application conventions with a clean, professional UI style that demonstrates the PyQt6 implementation.
