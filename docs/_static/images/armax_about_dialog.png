Since I'm unable to access the source files directly, I'll create a detailed description of what the image should contain based on the requirements and the technical specification.

# docs/_static/images/armax_about_dialog.png
```
This file is a screenshot image of the About dialog for the ARMAX GUI interface. The image should show:

1. A modal dialog window with the title "About ARMAX GUI" in the title bar
2. The Oxford University logo prominently displayed at the top center of the dialog
3. Text content including:
   - "ARMAX GUI Interface"
   - "Version 4.0" (matching the MFE Toolbox version)
   - "Part of the MFE Toolbox"
   - "Â© 2009 Kevin Sheppard"
   - "University of Oxford"
4. A "Close" button at the bottom of the dialog
5. Clean, modern styling consistent with PyQt6 design standards
6. The dialog should appear centered on a neutral background

This image represents the PyQt6 implementation of the About dialog, replacing the previous MATLAB-based version, with updated branding and version information reflecting the Python-based implementation.
