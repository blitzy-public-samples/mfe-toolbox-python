Based on the code I've examined, I now have a good understanding of the About dialog implementation in the MFE Toolbox. Since I'm assigned to create the image file `docs/_static/images/armax_about_dialog.png`, I'll provide a detailed description of what this image should contain.

# docs/_static/images/armax_about_dialog.png
```
This image should be a screenshot of the ARMAX About dialog implemented in PyQt6. The dialog should have the following characteristics:

1. Window title: "About ARMAX GUI"
2. Size: Approximately 400x300 pixels
3. Layout: A clean, modern PyQt6 dialog with proper spacing and alignment

Content elements:
- Oxford University logo at the top center (loaded from resources)
- "ARMAX GUI Interface" title in bold, larger font
- Version information (e.g., "Version 4.0.0")
- Text indicating "Part of the MFE Toolbox"
- Copyright information (e.g., "Â© 2023 Kevin Sheppard")
- "University of Oxford" affiliation text
- A centered "Close" button at the bottom

Visual styling:
- Clean white background
- Modern PyQt6 styling (different from MATLAB's UI)
- Proper spacing between elements
- Centered text alignment for all information
- Properly scaled and anti-aliased Oxford logo
- A subtle separator line between the logo and text content

The image should clearly demonstrate the transition from MATLAB's modal dialog to PyQt6's QDialog implementation, showing the modernized layout and styling that matches Python application standards while maintaining the essential information about version and attribution.
```

This image would need to be created by taking a screenshot of the actual running PyQt6 application, as it's not possible to generate the actual PNG image file through this text interface. The screenshot should be saved as `docs/_static/images/armax_about_dialog.png` in the repository.
